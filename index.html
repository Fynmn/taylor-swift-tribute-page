    <p>I walked through the door with you The air was cold But something about it felt like home somehow And I left my scarf there at your sister’s house And you’ve still got it in your drawer, even now Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze We’re
        singing in the car, getting lost upstate Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place And I can picture it after all these days And I know it’s long gone and That magic’s not here no more And I might be okay but I’m not fine at all ‘Cause
        there we are again on that little town street You almost ran the red ’cause you were lookin’ over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red You used to be a little kid
        with glasses in a twin-sized bed And your mother’s telling stories ’bout you on the tee-ball team You told me ’bout your past thinking your future was me And you were tossing me the car keys Fuck the patriarchy Keychain on the ground We were always
        skipping town And I was thinking on the drive down Anytime now he’s going to say it’s love You never called it what it was Till we were gone and dead and buried Check the pulse and come back swearing It’s the same After three months in the grave
        And then you wondered where it went to As I reached for you But all I felt was shame And you held my lifeless frame And I know it’s long gone and There was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to ‘Cause
        there we are again in the middle of the night We’re dancing ’round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well And there we are again When nobody had to know You kept me like a secret But I kept
        you like an oath Sacred prayer and we’d swear To remember it all too well And maybe we got lost in translation Maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece ‘Til you tore it all up Running scared, I was there I remember it
        all too well And you call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here ‘Cause I remember it all, all, all They say “All’s well that ends well” But I’m in
        a new hell everytime You double cross my mind You said if we had been closer in age Maybe it would’ve been fine That made me want to die The idea you had of me, who was she? An ever-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects Now I’m weeping
        in a party bathroom Some actress asking me what happened You, that’s what happened, you… You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes Sipping coffee like you’re on a late night show But when he watched me watch the front door all night willing
        you to come And he said it’s supposed to be fun turning 21 Time won’t fly, it’s like I’m paralyzed by it I’d like to be my old self again But I’m still trying to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail
        back my things and I walk home alone But you keep your old scarf from that very first week ‘Cause it reminds you of innocence And it smells like me You can’t get rid of it ‘Cause you remember it all too well Cause there we are again when I loved
        you so Back before you lost the one real thing you’ve ever known It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well And I was never good at telling jokes but the punchline goes “I’ll get older but your lovers stay my age” From when you’re Brooklyn
        broke, my skin and bones I’m a soldier who’s returning half her weight And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? Just between us, did the love affair maim you too? Cause in this city’s baring cold, I still remember the first fall of snow And
        how it glistened as it fell, I remember it all too well Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well? Just between us, do you remember it all too well? Just between us, I remember it all too well I walked through the door with you
        The air was cold But something about it felt like home somehow And I left my scarf there at your sister’s house And you’ve still got it in your drawer, even now Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze We’re singing in the car, getting

        That magic’s not here no more And I might be okay but I’m not fine at all ‘Cause there we are again on that little town street You almost ran the red ’cause you were lookin’ over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well Photo
        album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed And your mother’s telling stories ’bout you on the tee-ball team You told me ’bout your past thinking your future was me And you were
        tossing me the car keys Fuck the patriarchy Keychain on the ground We were always skipping town And I was thinking on the drive down Anytime now he’s going to say it’s love You never called it what it was Till we were gone and dead and buried
        Check the pulse and come back swearing It’s the same After three months in the grave And then you wondered where it went to As I reached for you But all I felt was shame And you held my lifeless frame And I know it’s long gone and There was nothing
        else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to ‘Cause there we are again in the middle of the night We’re dancing ’round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well
        And there we are again When nobody had to know You kept me like a secret But I kept you like an oath Sacred prayer and we’d swear To remember it all too well And maybe we got lost in translation Maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing
        was a masterpiece ‘Til you tore it all up Running scared, I was there I remember it all too well And you call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
        ‘Cause I remember it all, all, all They say “All’s well that ends well” But I’m in a new hell everytime You double cross my mind You said if we had been closer in age Maybe it would’ve been fine That made me want to die The idea you had of me,
